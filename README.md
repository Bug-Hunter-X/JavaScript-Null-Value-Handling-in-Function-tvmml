# JavaScript Null Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in JavaScript related to null value handling within a function. The `foo` function attempts to handle null values gracefully, but there might be edge cases or scenarios where this approach could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function adds two numbers. It correctly returns 0 if either parameter is `null`. However, in a more complex application, the function might be used with values other than numbers, which could lead to type errors.  Additionally,  a more robust approach may be desired to handle other falsy values besides `null`, depending on project requirements. 

## Bug Solution
The solution demonstrates a more robust approach, using type checking and providing a clear error message if unexpected data types are encountered.
